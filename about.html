      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p><em>Last updated: October 2025</em></p>

      <section>
        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>
          Born in Palmi, Calabria, on June 6th, 1985 — in that mythical, often forgotten corner of Southern Europe. 
          According to some I was Italian; for others, simply a <em>terrone</em>. Historians agree only that I was 
          the outcome of an unlikely symmetry breaking between a communist and a fascist — an event that, according 
          to physicists, occurred within a Planck-sized sphere over a Planck-time duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I speak <em>italiano</em>, English, <em>Deutsch</em>, and <em>Calabbrisi</em>. I consider myself a European 
          of Italian nationality — or, more precisely, Calabrian.
        </p>

        <h3>Facts (Not Too Seriously)</h3>
        <p>
          I was a Staff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory between 2020 and 2025.  
          Being from Southern Italy, it’s statistically unlikely that I’ll become famous — but that’s fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have few hobbies. I find squirrels and chipmunks funny, and I’m not particularly fond of spiders.  
          I sometimes dream of living on Craven Road no. 8, next door to Dylan Dog, my hero (or anti-hero).  
        </p>
                <img src="/img/craven.jpg" alt="Alba dei Morti Viventi - Dylan Dog" class="project-image-small" style="max-width:400px;" />

        <p>
          My favorite athlete used to be Oscar Pistorius. Now I root for Alex Zanardi.  
          To me, sport is about struggle rather than success.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also sell zero-point energy — <em>Nullpunktenergie</em> if you prefer the German sound — 
          for the fair price of £25 per box. <strong>Zero-Point Energy: Zero-Point in buying it!</strong>

        <h3>Things I Like</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a> used to be awesome.  

          GNU/Linux Ubuntu was even cooler.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to read <em>Repubblica</em>, <em>Corriere</em>, <em>Linkiesta</em>, now I only read <em>Il Post</em>;  
          they often disagree with each other and with themselves, which is comforting.  

        </p>
        <p>
          According to a random internet quiz, I am a night owl.

        <h3>Poetry and Humor</h3>
        <blockquote>
          来て見れば夕の桜実となりぬ  
          <br><em>When you come to see them, evening cherries have turned to fruit.</em>
          佔著茅坑不拉屎.
          <br><em>Sitting on the toilet, not taking a dump.</em>
          
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Ashes of Rome</h4>
        <p class="poem">
          Remo did not know that his brother<br>
          would kill him for the power of Rome.<br>
          Caesar felt the cold blade of Brutus<br>
          and cried for forgiveness.<br>
          Caligula should have known<br>
          that Claudius would sell his soul to the devil himself<br>
          so that Virginia and Nero could burn Rome to ashes.<br>
          This is why I canceled my flight to Rome.<br>
          <strong>Damnatio Memoriae.</strong>

        <h3>Where I’ve Lived</h3>
        <p>
          I currently work in Pisa. 
          Previously I lived in Los Alamos, Santa Fe.  Cambridge, London,  Oxford, Berlin, Waterloo (Canada), Pisa — 
          Canada is where I learned the true meaning of the word “cold.”  
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re depressed, remember: it can’t rain forever.  
          But if you live in Pisa… well, you might be an exception.
        </p>
        <p> I have an online presence. In the following forms:</p>
                <img src="/img/fc1.jpg" alt="FC" class="project-image-small" style="max-width:200px;"/> <img src="/img/fc2.png" alt="FC" class="project-image-small" style="max-width:200px;"/> <img src="/img/fc3.png" alt="FC" class="project-image-small" style="max-width:200px;"/>

        <h3>Miscellanea</h3>
        <p>
          I am a proud Calabrian.  
          I come from Magna Graecia — this is the ancient stamp of my region:
        </p>
        <img src="/img/magnagrecia.jpg" alt="Magna Graecia emblem" class="project-image-small" style="max-width:400px;" />
        <p>
          I plan to get it tattooed someday.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to love coding. My first contribution to Freshmeat (circa 2003) 
          was a text-based CD player for Linux — long lost, but not forgotten.
