          <em>Spectral Methods in Complex Systems</em> is a comprehensive yet accessible introduction
          to spectral methods in linear algebra and their applications across physics, computer science,
          and network theory. The book develops from the fundamentals — matrices, determinants,
          eigenvalues, and graph theory — into advanced topics such as perturbation theory, pseudospectra,
          functional calculus, and spectral decompositions. Throughout, emphasis is placed on practical
          tools and formulae rather than lengthy proofs, making the text a usable companion for students
          and researchers alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text collects an extensive library of results, identities, and worked-out equations. These
          mathematical tools are then placed in the context of complex systems applications: community
          detection, stability in ecology and economics, PageRank and ranking algorithms, epidemic
          spreading, synchronization, and memristive networks, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intended primarily for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students, the book also
          serves as a reference for researchers who wish to approach interdisciplinary problems from a
          spectral perspective. By weaving together linear algebra, dynamical systems, and network
          science, <em>Spectral Methods in Complex Systems</em> offers both a technical manual and a
          conceptual guide to the spectral viewpoint in modern complexity research.

          This book applies regional analysis to the challenges facing global investment agencies seeking
          to enhance trade in lagging regions. It shows how spatial interaction and agent-based modelling
          can be used as the basis for developing new plans and policies. An in-depth analysis of trade
          routes is presented, which can be used to develop policies for increasing efficiency and reducing
          costs. Landlocked Uganda and the sea-locked South Pacific Islands serve to illustrate the problems
          of covering sizable distances, accelerating export flows and improving supply-chain efficiency.
          These examples also provide an excellent illustration of the power of regional science, from
          assembling databases in difficult situations to developing and applying models of the trade system.
