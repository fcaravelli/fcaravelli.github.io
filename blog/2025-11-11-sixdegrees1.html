      <h2>Karinthy's chains and the six degree of separation idea - Francesco Caravelli</h2>
      <p class="post-date"><em>November 11, 2025</em></p>
      <p> I recently finished the italian translation of <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1657001.A_Journey_Round_My_Skull">A journey round my skull</a></em> (Viaggio intorno al mio cranio in italian),
        by Frigyes Karinthy, a Hungarian writer and poet known for his wit and humor. The book is a semi-autobiographical account of his experience with a brain tumor, 
        and it blends some (uninformed) medical observations with philosophical reflections, and accounts of allucinations. In the very first chapters, he talks about invisible trains. 
        It is the first known account of a patient going through an open skull surgery.
        However, as I got to the end of the book I realized that there was a bonus: an essay titled Chains (Catene), which is considered the origin of the
        <em>six degrees of separation</em> concept. This idea suggests that any two people on Earth are connected through a chain of acquaintances with no more than five intermediaries,
        meaning that the total number of connections is six. This concept has fascinated sociologists, psychologists, and network scientists for decades, leading to various studies and experiments to explore the small-world phenomenon. 
        The essay starts with
          <p>
            "Here is an element of crucial importance" I said vehemently in the course of a discussion. We were discussing progress and the whether the world was going in any direction, for real,
            or whether these were mere set phrases. The eternal return of something that always existed (I translated it).
          </p>
        The essay was written 1929. I recognized a few sentences from the essay. "The worker knows his boss who knows Mr. Ford", you can see how the chains of knowledges start. I did not know that the concept had started in literature.
      </p>

      <p>Now, Karinthy was Hungarian. And so was Paul Erdős who studied the idea from a mathematical point of view. Erdős is also well known because among mathematicians and physicists
        there is the concept of the <em>Erdős number</em>, which describes the "collaborative distance" between an author and Erdős in terms of co-authored mathematical papers.
        For example, if you co-authored a paper with Erdős, your Erdős number is 1. If you co-authored a paper with someone who has an Erdős number of 1, your Erdős number is 2, and so on.
        This concept has become a playful way to illustrate the interconnectedness of the mathematical community and has been extended to other fields as well. My Erdős number is \(3^2\), I have 
        papers both with Leonardo Banchi and Simone Severini, who published respectively with Chris Godsil and Peter Cameron respectively, and them both published at least one paper with Erdős.
        I also have a paper with Seth Lloyd, who has Erdős number 2, and with Toufik Mansour, who has Erdős number 3, so I have multiple paths to Erdős but the shortest is 3.
        And so on and so forth. Among non-scientists, one can also use the Bacon number (the actor).
      </p>

      <p>A proper way of looking at this is through graph theory. In this framework, the “six degrees” hypothesis simply means that the <em>average path length</em> 
      between any two people is surprisingly small. For a network \( G = (V, E) \), 
      with \( V \) the set of individuals and \( E \) the set of connections, the average distance is</p>

      <p class="math">
      \[
      L(G) = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i \neq j} d(v_i, v_j),
      \]
      </p>

      <p>where \( d(v_i, v_j) \) measures the length of the shortest path between \( v_i \) and \( v_j \). 
      What Karinthy sensed intuitively is that \( L(G) \) grows very slowly with the number of people \( n \); 
      even as the world’s population explodes, we remain only a handful of introductions away from anyone. </p>

      <p>This “small world” behavior was rediscovered and formalized decades later by 
      <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/30918">Watts and Strogatz (1998)</a>. One might say that 
      this is the paper that kickstarted the whole field of network theory among physicists, engineers, computer scientists 
      and in particular in statistical mechanics. The field was particularly successful (I think) because the premise is quite simple, e.g. 
      graphs are easy to describe, only a set of nodes and edges. Graph theory is however one of the touhghest mathematical fields,
      with many open problems. Watts and Strogatz built on earlier work by 
      <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.275.5301.412">Milgram (1967)</a>, who conducted the famous 
      “small world experiment.” In this study, Milgram sent packages to random individuals in 
      the Midwest, asking them to forward the package to a target person in Boston, but only through acquaintances. 
      The surprising result was that the average number of intermediaries needed to reach the target was around six, 
      providing empirical support for the “six degrees of separation” idea.
      Watts and Strogatz showed that many real networks — not just social ones, 
      but biological, technological, and even neural — share two striking properties: 
      high clustering (your friends tend to know each other) and short average path length 
      (you can reach almost anyone in a few steps). The combination of these two features defines 
      what we now call a <em>small-world network</em>. </p>

      <p>In quantitative terms, one can compare a real network’s structure to that of a random one 
      with the same number of nodes and links. If \( C \) and \( L \) denote the clustering and 
      average path length, and \( C_{\text{rand}} \), \( L_{\text{rand}} \) their random equivalents, 
      the small-worldness coefficient</p>

      <p class="math">
      \[
      \sigma = \frac{C / C_{\text{rand}}}{L / L_{\text{rand}}}
      \]
      </p>

      <p>is typically greater than one — a signature that a network is simultaneously 
      <em>locally dense</em> and <em>globally connected</em>. 
      The same concept applies to large number of networks. </p>

      <h3>The Watts–Strogatz Model</h3>

    <p>The beauty of the small-world idea is that it can be made precise. 
    In that same paper of 1998, Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz proposed a simple model to show 
    how networks can be both highly clustered and yet have very short path lengths. 
    They began with an ordered ring of \( n \) nodes, each connected to its \( k \) nearest neighbors. 
    This configuration is perfectly regular: everyone knows their immediate neighbors, 
    and information diffuses slowly along the ring. </p>

    <p>Then, with probability \( p \), each edge is <em>rewired</em> — its endpoint connected 
    to a random node instead of a nearby one. When \( p = 0 \), the graph remains a 
    regular lattice; when \( p = 1 \), it becomes a random graph in the Erdős–Rényi sense. 
    For small but nonzero \( p \), something remarkable happens: 
    the average path length \( L(p) \) drops rapidly, while the clustering coefficient \( C(p) \) 
    remains high. The result is a network that is both locally coherent and globally efficient — 
    a mathematical incarnation of Karinthy’s intuition and a blessing for many statistical physicists interested in 
    this type of models (percolation transition is just one example). </p>

    <p>In symbols, the model shows a transition such that</p>

    <p class="math">
    \[
    L(p) \approx L_{\text{rand}} \quad \text{for small } p,
    \]
    \[
    C(p) \gg C_{\text{rand}},
    \]
    </p>

    <p>capturing the essence of the small-world phenomenon: 
    just a few random long-range connections are enough to 
    collapse distances in a vast network. 
    . </p>
