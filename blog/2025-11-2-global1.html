      <h2>Globally Controlled Quantum Architectures</h2>
      <p class="post-date"><em>November 2, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        At <strong>Planckian</strong>, the concept of globally controlled superconducting processors
        emerged from a simple but radical question: how much of quantum control can be made
        <em>global</em> without losing computational universality?
        Before I joined the company, the foundations of this idea had already been laid by
        <strong>Roberto Menta</strong>, <strong>Francesco Cioni</strong>, and <strong>Riccardo Aiudi</strong>,
        who demonstrated that ZZ interactions — the natural longitudinal couplings between
        transmon qubits — could serve not as a nuisance to be tuned away, but as a fundamental
        resource for computation. In Rydberg atoms this was introduced through the Rydberg blockade by Cesa and Pichler;
        in superconducting circuits, it translates into a regime where qubit excitations become
        conditional on the state of their neighbors.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I joined Planckian, under the guidance of Marco Polini and
        Vittorio Giovannetti I began leading the day to day operations of theory group to
        develop the architectural, computational and analytical framework behind these globally driven systems.
        Our goal is to show experimentally and theoretically that local addressability can, paradoxically, emerge from the physics
        of collective control — a philosophy that has now crystallized into what we call the
        <strong>crossed-qubit architecture</strong>. In our minds, scalability is very important.
      </p>

      <p>
        The motivation is well known to anyone who has worked on large-scale superconducting
        systems: every qubit demands multiple control lines, calibration routines, and cryogenic
        interfaces. The resulting wiring complexity quickly becomes unmanageable. Global control,
        by contrast, offers a way to collapse this hardware overhead into a handful of synchronized
        microwave pulses that act on entire <em>species</em> of qubits at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this framework, the processor’s Hamiltonian can be written schematically as
      </p>

        <p class="math">
        \[
        \hat{H}(t) = \sum_i \frac{\hbar \omega_i}{2} \hat{\sigma}^z_i +
        \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \frac{\hbar \zeta}{2} \hat{\sigma}^z_i \hat{\sigma}^z_j +
        \sum_{\chi \in S} V_{\chi}(t) \sum_{i \in \chi} V_i \hat{\sigma}^y_i
        \]
        </p>


      <p>
        where each species $\\chi$ corresponds to a subset of qubits that share the same global
        drive 
        <p class="math">
        \[ 
            V_{\chi}(t) = A_{\chi}(t) \sin(\omega_{d,\chi} t + \phi_{\chi}(t))
        \]
        </p>
        Adjacent qubits never belong to the same species, ensuring that the always-on ZZ interactions
        connect only different classes of qubits. This architectural symmetry — and its deliberate
        breaking — is what makes the system controllable. We outlined this in a recent paper, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09271.pdf">this paper here and citations therein</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>crossed-qubit method</strong> achieves this by introducing static inhomogeneities
        in the qubit–drive coupling strengths. During fabrication, certain qubits are engineered
        to couple twice as strongly to the global field as their regular neighbors, leading to
        Rabi frequencies
      </p>

 <p class="math">
  \[
  \Omega_{\chi,i}(t) =
  \begin{cases}
  \Omega_{\chi,r}(t) = \dfrac{A_{\chi}(t)\,\bar{V}}{\hbar}, & i \in \chi_r, \\\\[8pt]
  \Omega_{\chi,\times}(t) = 2\,\Omega_{\chi,r}(t), & i \in \chi_{\times}.
  \end{cases}
  \]
</p>


      <p>
        This fabrication asymmetry is the seed of local control. When the system operates in the
        so-called <em>blockade regime</em>, defined by 
        
        <p class="math">
        \[
        \left|\frac{\zeta}{\Omega_{\chi,r}}\right| \gg 1
        \]
        </p>
        excitations
        become conditional: a qubit cannot flip if one of its neighbors is already excited. The result
        is a form of <em>emergent locality</em> — a regime where a single global pulse can trigger
        targeted, conditional rotations within a sea of qubits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mathematically, the corresponding control unitary reads
      </p>

        <p class="math">
        \[
        \hat{W}_j(\theta_j, \mathbf{n}_j) =
        \hat{\mathbb{1}}_j \otimes \hat{Q}_{\langle j \rangle} +
        \hat{R}_j(\theta_j, \mathbf{n}_j) \otimes \hat{P}_{\langle j \rangle}
        \]
        </p>


      <p>
        where 
        <p class="math">
        \[
        \hat{R}_j(\theta_j, \mathbf{n}_j) =
        e^{-i (\theta_j / 2)\, \mathbf{n}_j \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}_j}
        \]
        </p>
        
        is a single-qubit
        rotation acting only on unblocked sites — those whose neighbors remain in the ground state.
        This is how <em>locality</em> arises from <em>globality</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Historically, global control traces back to the work of <strong>Seth Lloyd</strong> in the early 1990s,
        and later to <strong>Simon Benjamin</strong>, who reduced the required number of qubit species to two.
        Yet these were conceptual blueprints, detached from hardware. What we and our collaborators
        at Planckian have been able to demonstrate is that the same principles can now be realized
        in a physically grounded setting — in superconducting circuits, with natural ZZ interactions,
        and using no more than two or three global control lines.
      </p>

      <p>
        In these architectures, wiring is replaced by geometry, and calibration by symmetry.
        Gates are not applied through individual addresses but through designed differences:
        static, architectural asymmetries that translate a uniform pulse into a structured evolution.
        The pulse is the same everywhere — yet the system itself encodes where it matters more.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the essence of <em>global control</em>: a reversal of the usual paradigm of quantum
        engineering, in which minimal asymmetry and maximal coherence combine to produce
        addressable computation through collective motion.
      </p>

<!-- === Part II: Overcoming Disorder in Superconducting Global Architectures === -->

<h3>Overcoming Disorder in Superconducting Global Architectures</h3>

<p>
  Let me now discuss the recent paper that appeared on the arXiv on disorder. One of the practical hurdles in bringing globally controlled architectures from elegant theory to
  <em>artificial atoms</em> is <strong>static disorder</strong>. Rydberg arrays enjoy a natural uniformity; transmons do not.
  Nanometer-level variations in Josephson junctions become small offsets in qubit frequencies and couplings,
  and even a few percent is enough to desynchronize a processor that is steered by the same global pulse everywhere.
  In our recent Planckian study (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25996">Overcoming Disorder in Superconducting Global Architectures by Aiudi, Despres, Menta, Abedi, Menichetti, Giovannetti, Polini, and I</a>),
  we quantified precisely how such inhomogeneities affect the ladder architecture and showed how to
  <em>compensate them in software</em> via pulse design.
</p>

<p>
  In the disorder-free picture, uniform drives shift the <em>information-carrying column</em> (ICC) coherently across the ladder.
  With fabrication inhomogeneities, local qubit frequencies and couplings become random variables,
</p>

<p class="math">
  \[
  \omega_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\omega},\,\epsilon\,\bar{\omega})
  \qquad\text{and}\qquad
  \zeta_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\zeta},\,\epsilon\,\bar{\zeta})\,,
  \]
</p>

<p>
  and the single global command no longer produces an identical response on every site. In practice, frequency disorder
  is the dominant culprit: it distorts resonance conditions and quickly erodes the fidelity of information transport and gates
  if left uncorrected. The key is to make the global pulses <em>learn</em> the specific, static imperfections of the chip.
</p>

<h4>What GRAPE is </h4>

<p>
  We addressed the problem with <strong>quantum optimal control</strong>, using the
  <em>Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering</em> algorithm (GRAPE). It was introduced by Glaser and collaborators in NMR (see this nice presentation <a href="https://michaelgoerz.net/research/grape_june_2010_slides.pdf">here</a>). Conceptually, GRAPE treats the waveform
  of each control channel as a collection of tunable parameters and adjusts them to make the device’s evolution
  match a desired target operation despite disorder.
</p>

<p>
  Write the control Hamiltonian as
</p>

<p class="math">
  \[
  \hat{H}(t) \;=\; \hat{H}_0 \;+\; \sum_{j=1}^{N_c} u_j(t)\,\hat{H}_j\,,
  \]
</p>

<p>
  where \(\hat{H}_0\) contains the on-chip physics (local energies and ZZ interactions) and the
  \(u_j(t)\) are the time-dependent control amplitudes. In our globally driven ladder,
  the controls are the two quadratures (X,Y) for each species \(\chi\in\{A,B,C\}\), so \(N_c=6\).
  We discretize time into short slots and optimize the pulse vector
  \(\{u_j(t_k)\}\) to minimize a gate mismatch cost, e.g. the trace-distance–based objective
</p>

<p class="math">
  \[
  E \;=\; 1 \;-\; \frac{1}{d}\,\Bigl|\mathrm{Tr}\!\big[\hat{U}(T)\,\hat{U}_{\mathrm{target}}^{\dagger}\big]\Bigr|\,,
  \]
</p>

<p>
  where \(\hat{U}(T)\) is the propagator generated by the candidate pulses and
  \(\hat{U}_{\mathrm{target}}\) is the desired unitary (shift step, single–qubit rotation, or CZ).
  GRAPE computes gradients \(\partial E/\partial u_j(t_k)\) efficiently via forward–backward propagation and
  updates the amplitudes along the negative gradient (gradient ascent on fidelity).
  Because the disorder is <em>static</em>, once measured it can be explicitly included in \(\hat{H}_0\), allowing the
  optimizer to “bake in” the necessary corrections.
</p>

<h4>How optimized global pulses differ from the naive ones</h4>

<p>
  In the idealized, homogeneous design, control is “bang–bang”: one species at a time, square pulses, strict time windows.
  After optimization on a disordered chip, the global pulses look different:
  all species can be driven simultaneously, with small, carefully phased oscillations in both quadratures.
  Those gentle modulations create destructive interference against the unwanted, disorder-induced phase accumulation.
  In short, <em>we use fluctuations to cancel fluctuations</em>.
</p>

<p>
  At the architectural level, nothing changes — the processor is still globally driven, ZZ-coupled, and arranged in the same ladder.
  What changes is the <em>waveform</em>: the control software supplies the missing uniformity that hardware cannot guarantee.
  Numerically we find that optimized sequences restore high-fidelity information transport and single- and two-qubit gates
  under realistic frequency spreads, and they can be further compressed in time while keeping performance high.
</p>


<p>
  Global control was first attractive because it slashes wiring and calibration overhead. The worry was that solid-state disorder would
  make it too brittle compared to natural platforms. The lesson here is the opposite: once disorder is measured,
  <em>global control absorbs it</em>. The emergent blockade physics still functions; the ICC still moves; the logical gates still execute.
  Uniformity can be manufactured at the pulse level, allowing globally controlled superconducting processors to retain their
  hardware simplicity while achieving the fidelities required for useful algorithms.
</p>

<p>
  In the broader Planckian program, this closes a loop that began with the crossed-qubit idea and the exploitation of ZZ interactions:
  symmetry in the architecture, mild and deliberate asymmetry in the hardware, and adaptability in the pulses. Together, they turn a
  global command into local, conditional action — now robust to the imperfections of real transmons. Of course, one would have to be careful
  when implementing this in real hardware, as GRAPE's pulses still excite higher levels of the transmon. 
  But this is a problem that can be mitigated with further constraints in the optimization, not to be discussed here.
