      <h2>A visit to Jagellonian University in Krakow and Turing Instabilities</h2>
        <p class="post-date"><em>November 30, 2025</em></p>
        I was recently visiting Krakow to give a talk at Jagellonian University. This is not my first visit,
        as I had the pleasure of collaborating with some of the faculty there in the past.
        This time around, the visit was centered around quantum computing with global control.
        It was a great experience to interact with the local researchers and students. 
        The city itself is beautiful, with a rich history and vibrant culture, but I was there only for less than two days.
        I had the chance other times to explore some of the historic sites other times, 
        enjoy the local cuisine, and attend some fascinating lectures. This time I was mostly focused on work, so I didn't get to 
        see much of the city this time around as I was staying near the University.
        
        I did however manage to have quite a few interesting discussions with faculty members and students, and in particular
        Ewa Gudowska-Nowak, who is an expert in complex systems and statistical physics, and Maciej Nowak who is a well-known figure in 
        random matrix theory and its applications to physics. 
        A visitor (whom I am sorry I do not remember the name) was giving a talk on Turing patterns, and did mention
        that actually Ewa was a student of Prigogine in Brussels (the Nobel prize in Chemistry), and had worked on reaction-diffusion systems in the past.
        I have to admit that I know quite little about Turing patterns, so I was intrigued to learn more about them.
        So, that night I found an 
        <a href="https://www.cheetah.fi/teemuleppanen/content/science/turing/publications/teemu_leppanen_chapter_theory_turing.pdf">introduction</a> to the topic by Lappänen and 
        wrote a short derivation summary of the classic Turing instability. I thought it would be useful to share it here as well.
        There is a nice article on Turing patterns on Wikipedia as well, and also I suggest this paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00306-0">here</a>.
        This fits well with other readings I have been doing on pattern formation, such as von Neumann's work on cellular automata.

 
<p>
Turing patterns arise in reaction–diffusion systems when a spatially uniform fixed point, stable in the absence of diffusion,
becomes unstable once diffusion is introduced. This instability occurs because different diffusion rates modify the linear
stability of perturbations in a wavenumber-dependent way.
</p>

<h3>Reaction–Diffusion Model</h3>

<p>
We consider two scalar fields:
<ul>
  <li>$u(x,t)$: concentration of species 1</li>
  <li>$v(x,t)$: concentration of species 2</li>
</ul>
on a spatial domain $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ and time $t$.
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\partial_t u = f(u,v) + D_u \nabla^2 u,\qquad
\partial_t v = g(u,v) + D_v \nabla^2 v.
\]
</p>

<p>
Here $f(u,v)$ and $g(u,v)$ are local reaction terms, and $D_u,D_v\ge 0$ are diffusion coefficients.
$\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian, causing spatial smoothing.
</p>

<h3>Homogeneous Fixed Point</h3>

<p>
A well-mixed fixed point $(u_*,v_*)$ satisfies
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
f(u_*,v_*) = 0,\qquad g(u_*,v_*) = 0.
\]
</p>

<p>
If diffusion is ignored, the system reduces to the ODEs $\dot{u}=f(u,v)$, $\dot{v}=g(u,v)$.
Stability of this fixed point requires
$\mathrm{tr}J<0$ and $\det J>0$, where $J$ is the Jacobian of $(f,g)$ evaluated at $(u_*,v_*)$.
</p>

<h3>Linearization</h3>

<p>
Write perturbations $u=u_*+\delta u$, $v=v_*+\delta v$, with $|\delta u|,|\delta v|\ll 1$.
Linearizing gives
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\partial_t
\begin{pmatrix}\delta u \\ \delta v\end{pmatrix}
=
J\begin{pmatrix}\delta u \\ \delta v\end{pmatrix}
+
D\nabla^2\begin{pmatrix}\delta u \\ \delta v\end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
J=
\begin{pmatrix}f_u & f_v \\ g_u & g_v\end{pmatrix},
\qquad
D=\begin{pmatrix}D_u & 0 \\ 0 & D_v\end{pmatrix}.
\]
</p>

<h3>Fourier Modes and Dispersion Relation</h3>

<p>
Use Fourier modes $\delta u,\delta v\propto e^{\sigma t+i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}$.
Because $\nabla^2 e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}=-k^2 e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{x}}$,
we obtain
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\sigma\begin{pmatrix}\hat u\\ \hat v\end{pmatrix}
=
\bigl(J - k^2 D\bigr)\begin{pmatrix}\hat u\\ \hat v\end{pmatrix}.
\]
</p>

<p>
Thus, for each wavenumber $k$, the growth rates $\sigma(k)$ are the eigenvalues of $J-k^2D$.
A Turing instability occurs when the fixed point is stable at $k=0$, but unstable for some $k>0$.
</p>
<p>
For each wavenumber $k$, the growth rates $\sigma(k)$ satisfy the characteristic equation
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\sigma^2 - \tau(k)\sigma + \Delta(k) = 0,
\]
\[
\tau(k)=\operatorname{tr}J - (D_u + D_v)k^2,\qquad
\Delta(k)=\det J - (D_v f_u + D_u g_v)\,k^2 + D_u D_v k^4.
\]
</p>

<p>
Here $\tau(k)$ is the trace and $\Delta(k)$ the determinant of the effective Jacobian $J - k^2 D$.
A Fourier mode of wavelength $2\pi/k$ grows when $\Re\,\sigma(k)&gt;0$.
</p>

<h3>Stability at $k=0$</h3>

<p>
At zero wavenumber, $\tau(0)=\operatorname{tr}J$ and $\Delta(0)=\det J$.
The homogeneous fixed point is stable in the well-mixed limit when
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\operatorname{tr}J &lt; 0,\qquad \det J &gt; 0.
\]
</p>

<h3>Instability for Some $k &gt; 0$</h3>

<p>
Diffusion introduces the $k^2$-dependent modifications to $\tau(k)$ and $\Delta(k)$.
Since $\tau(k)$ decreases monotonically with $k^2$, diffusion cannot change its sign.
Instability must therefore arise from $\Delta(k)$.
</p>

<p>
The determinant is a quadratic polynomial in $k^2$:
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\Delta(k) = \det J - (D_v f_u + D_u g_v)k^2 + D_u D_v k^4.
\]
</p>

<p>
A Turing instability occurs only if $\Delta(k)$ becomes negative for some $k&gt;0$.
For a $2\times 2$ system, this is equivalent to the two conditions:
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
D_v f_u + D_u g_v &gt; 0,\qquad
\left( D_v f_u + D_u g_v \right)^2 &gt; 4 D_u D_v\,\det J.
\]
</p>

<p>
These conditions ensure that the quadratic in $k^2$ has real, positive roots and that $\Delta(k)$ is negative on an interval $(k_-,k_+)$.
Equal diffusion coefficients $D_u=D_v$ cannot satisfy these inequalities, so identical diffusion rates cannot generate a Turing instability.
</p>

<h3>Band of Unstable Modes</h3>

<p>
The eigenvalues associated with wavenumber $k$ are
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\sigma_\pm(k)
=
\frac{ \tau(k) \pm \sqrt{\tau(k)^2 - 4\Delta(k)} }{2}.
\]
</p>

<p>
Instability requires $\Delta(k)&lt;0$ and a real discriminant.
The set of wavenumbers $k\in(k_-,k_+)$ for which $\Re\,\sigma_+(k)&gt;0$ defines the band of unstable modes.
The dominant pattern scale corresponds to the $k$ that maximizes $\sigma_+(k)$.
</p>

<p>
Thus diffusion modifies the linearized dynamics in a $k$-dependent way, and unequal diffusion rates can invert stability at finite wavenumber while preserving stability at $k=0$.
This is the defining feature of the Turing mechanism.
</p>
<h3>Brusselator Example</h3>

<p>
Now, as mentioned at the beginning, a standard reaction–diffusion system exhibiting a Turing instability is the <em>Brusselator</em>, defined by
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
f(u,v) = A - (B+1)u + u^2 v, \qquad
g(u,v) = Bu - u^2 v,
\]
</p>

<p>
where $A&gt;0$ and $B&gt;0$ are constant feed parameters. The variables $u(x,t)$ and $v(x,t)$ represent the concentrations of two chemical species in an autocatalytic reaction scheme.
</p>

<p>
The homogeneous fixed point is
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
u_* = A, \qquad v_* = \frac{B}{A}.
\]
</p>

<p>
Linearization at $(u_*,v_*)$ gives the Jacobian
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
J =
\begin{pmatrix}
B-1 & A^2\\
-B & -A^2
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
\]
</p>

<p>
In the absence of diffusion, the fixed point is stable when $B &lt; 1 + A^2$, ensuring $\operatorname{tr}J&lt;0$ and $\det J&gt;0$.
</p>

<p>
Including diffusion,
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\partial_t u = f(u,v) + D_u \nabla^2 u, \qquad
\partial_t v = g(u,v) + D_v \nabla^2 v,
\]
</p>

<p>
changes the stability of the Fourier modes. A Turing instability arises when $D_v \gg D_u$, so that the determinant
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
\Delta(k) = \det J - (D_v f_u + D_u g_v)k^2 + D_u D_v k^4
\]
</p>

<p>
is negative in the interval $k\in(k_-,k_+)$. For the Brusselator, the sign structure of $(f_u,f_v,g_u,g_v)$ matches the activator–inhibitor heuristic: $u$ acts as an activator and $v$ as an inhibitor.
</p>

<p>
The resulting patterns are spatially inhomogeneous steady states with a characteristic 
wavelength determined by the maximizer of $\sigma_+(k)$ (see the image below). 
Nonlinear terms fix the final amplitude but not the selected length scale.
