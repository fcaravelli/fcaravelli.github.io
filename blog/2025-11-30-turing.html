      <h2>A visit to Jagellonian University in Krakow</h2>
        <p class="post-date"><em>November 30, 2025</em></p>
        I was recently visiting Krakow to give a talk at Jagellonian University. This is not my first visit,
        as I had the pleasure of collaborating with some of the faculty there in the past.
        This time around, the visit was centered around quantum computing with global control.
        It was a great experience to interact with the local researchers and students. 
        The city itself is beautiful, with a rich history and vibrant culture, but I was there only for less than two days.
        I had the chance other times to explore some of the historic sites other times, 
        enjoy the local cuisine, and attend some fascinating lectures. This time I was mostly focused on work, so I didn't get to 
        see much of the city this time around as I was staying near the University.
        
        I did however manage to have quite a few interesting discussions with faculty members and students, and in particular
        Ewa Gudowska-Nowak, who is an expert in complex systems and statistical physics, and Maciej Nowak who is a well-known figure in 
        random matrix theory and its applications to physics. 
        A visitor (whom I am sorry I do not remember the name) was giving a talk on Turing patterns, and did mention
        that actually Ewa was a student of Prigogine in Brussels (the Nobel prize in Chemistry), and had worked on reaction-diffusion systems in the past.
        I have to admit that I know quite little about Turing patterns, so I was intrigued to learn more about them.
        So, that night I found an 
        <a href="https://www.cheetah.fi/teemuleppanen/content/science/turing/publications/teemu_leppanen_chapter_theory_turing.pdf">introduction</a> to the topic by Lappänen and 
        wrote a short derivation summary of the classic Turing instability. I thought it would be useful to share it here as well.
        There is a nice article on Turing patterns on Wikipedia as well, and also I suggest this paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00306-0">here</a>.
        This fits well with other readings I have been doing on pattern formation, such as von Neumann's work on cellular automata.

      <h2>Turing Patterns via Jacobian Instability</h2>
      <p class="post-date"><em>November 25, 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        In 1952, Alan Turing proposed that the interplay between local reactions and diffusion can destabilize a uniform state and
        generate spatial structure. Here I derive the classic <em>diffusion–driven instability</em> (Turing instability) in a concise way:
        start from a continuous two–species model, linearize around a homogeneous fixed point, and analyze the
        wave–number–dependent Jacobian to identify when modes grow.
      </p>

      <h3>Reaction–Diffusion Model</h3>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \partial_t u = f(u,v) + D_u \nabla^2 u,\qquad
        \partial_t v = g(u,v) + D_v \nabla^2 v,
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        with $u(x,t), v(x,t)$ scalar fields, $f,g$ smooth reaction terms, and $D_u,D_v \ge 0$ diffusion coefficients.
        Let $(u_*,v_*)$ be a homogeneous fixed point: $f(u_*,v_*)=0$, $g(u_*,v_*)=0$.
        Define the Jacobian (reaction linearization) at the fixed point:
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        J =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        f_u & f_v\\
        g_u & g_v
        \end{pmatrix}_{(u_*,v_*)},
        \qquad
        \operatorname{tr}J = f_u+g_v,\quad
        \det J = f_u g_v - f_v g_u.
        \]
      </p>

      <h3>Linearization and Dispersion Relation</h3>

      <p>
        Consider small perturbations $u=u_*+\delta u$, $v=v_*+\delta v$.
        After Fourier decomposing $\propto e^{\sigma t + i \mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{x}}$ with $k=\lVert \mathbf{k}\rVert$, the linearized dynamics is:
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \sigma\,\begin{pmatrix}\hat u\\ \hat v\end{pmatrix}
        =
        \bigl(J - k^2 D\bigr)\begin{pmatrix}\hat u\\ \hat v\end{pmatrix},
        \qquad
        D=\begin{pmatrix} D_u & 0\\ 0 & D_v\end{pmatrix}.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore $\sigma(k)$ are the eigenvalues of $J - k^2 D$, equivalently the roots of
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \sigma^2 - \tau(k)\,\sigma + \Delta(k) = 0,
        \]
        \[
        \tau(k)=\operatorname{tr}J - (D_u + D_v)k^2,\qquad
        \Delta(k)=\det J - (D_v f_u + D_u g_v)\,k^2 + D_u D_v k^4.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        Stability requires $\Re\,\sigma(k)&lt;0$ for all $k$. A <em>Turing instability</em> means the fixed point is stable
        to spatially uniform perturbations ($k=0$) but unstable to some $k&gt;0$.
      </p>

      <h3>Conditions for Diffusion–Driven Instability</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Stability without diffusion (well–mixed):</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \operatorname{tr}J = f_u + g_v &lt; 0,
        \qquad
        \det J = f_u g_v - f_v g_u &gt; 0.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Instability induced by diffusion:</strong> there exists $k&gt;0$ with $\Re\,\sigma(k)&gt;0$.
        For $2\times2$ systems this occurs if and only if the following hold in addition to the above:
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        D_v f_u + D_u g_v &gt; 0,
        \qquad
        \bigl(D_v f_u + D_u g_v\bigr)^2 - 4 D_u D_v \det J &gt; 0.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        Intuitively, diffusion must skew the effective Jacobian enough to flip the sign of a mode:
        one species should act as a slowly diffusing <em>activator</em> (typically $D_u$ small) and the other as a
        fast diffusing <em>inhibitor</em> (typically $D_v \gg D_u$), so that mixed terms $D_v f_u + D_u g_v$ are positive and large.
        If $D_u=D_v$, diffusion merely shifts eigenvalues uniformly and cannot create a Turing pattern.
      </p>

      <h3>Most Unstable Wavelength</h3>

      <p>
        The growth rate is
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \sigma_\pm(k)=\frac{\tau(k)\pm\sqrt{\tau(k)^2-4\Delta(k)}}{2}.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        When the conditions above hold, there is a band $k\in(k_-,k_+)$ with $\Re\,\sigma_+(k)&gt;0$.
        The selected pattern scale is near the maximizer of $\Re\,\sigma_+(k)$, which, to leading order, is controlled by
        the quadratic form in $\Delta(k)$ and the linear decay in $\tau(k)$ with $k^2$.
      </p>

      <h3>Sign Structure (Activator–Inhibitor Heuristic)</h3>

      <p>
        A common minimal sign pattern near $(u_*,v_*)$ is
        $f_u&gt;0$ (self–activation), $g_v&lt;0$ (self–inhibition), $f_v&gt;0$ (v promotes u), $g_u&lt;0$ (u inhibits v),
        with $D_v\gg D_u$. This typically satisfies the stability-at-$k=0$ constraints while enabling the two diffusion
        inequalities to hold, thus producing stationary spots/stripes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a follow–up, I’ll contrast this <em>continuous-field</em> route to pattern formation with
        von Neumann’s <em>discrete</em> cellular automata, where local rules similarly create global order—but computation itself is the “reaction.”
