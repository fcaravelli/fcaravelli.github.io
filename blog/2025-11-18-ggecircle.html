      <h2>Weird effects of conservations laws in Statistical Mechanics</h2>
      <p class="post-date"><em>November 18, 2025</em></p>
        <p>
            In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding how conservation laws
            affect the dynamics and equilibration of many-body systems. While traditional statistical mechanics
            often assumes that systems relax to thermal equilibrium, the presence of additional conserved quantities
            can lead to non-thermal steady states and anomalous transport properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the key insights in this area comes from the study of integrable systems, which possess an extensive
            number of conserved quantities. These systems do not thermalize in the conventional sense; instead, they
            relax to a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) that accounts for all conserved quantities. This has profound
            implications for our understanding of thermalization and ergodicity in quantum systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the quantum case this has been studied extensively in the context of cold atomic gases, where experiments have observed
            signatures of GGE behavior. Theoretical work has also explored how conservation laws can lead to
            anomalous diffusion and transport phenomena, such as superdiffusion or subdiffusion, d
            epending on the nature of the conserved quantities.
        </p>

        <p> However, I had not personally seen a lot of studies in the classical case (except those by Cugliandolo and collaborators). 
            Yet, if one opens an old book in statistical mechanics,
            these effects were quite known - for instance in the book by Tolman, he explicitly write that these cases are of no practical interest
            because the perfect boundary does not exist. This is of course true, but still, it is interesting to see how these effects manifest in simple models.
            Symmetry and boundaries go hand in hand, and it is interesting to see how the shape of the boundary can affect the dynamics of particles inside a container.
        </p>

        <p> I had not appreciated this until some short time ago. Marc Vuffray and I were involved in a project for Los Alamos. As he was walking out of my office one time,
            we started to discuss (for reasons that I do not recall precisely), the effect of boundaries in classical systems with conservation laws.
            In particular, he mentioned that he did not understand as a teenager or first year student in Physics, 
            why the classical gas contained in a disk or in a sphere should be distributed according to the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
            I thought that he was quite right about that, and him and I started to discuss how one could simulate this effect and 
            how to make some analytical progress. The result is this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08833" target="_blank">here</a> This is, in a sense, quite similar to the GGE case I mentioned above, but in which
            there is a single extra conservation law other than Energy: the total angular momentum with respect to the center of the container.
            This is only the case of the circular or spherical container, because of rotational symmetry - but it is not the case otherwise. 
            I also this is a particular instructive case, as it shows in a particularly simple problem how symmetry and conservation laws are intertwined.
            At the end of this post you'll see a link to a simulator where you can experiment yourself.


        </p>

        <p>
            To make these ideas more concrete, let us consider a simple classical model: 
            a gas of $N$ identical point particles of unit mass, confined inside a 
            two–dimensional container, either circular or square, and interacting only through
            hard–core elastic collisions. The total energy of the system is conserved:
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            \[ 
             E = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{|\mathbf{p}_i|^2}{2}.
             \]

        </p>

        <p>
            When the boundary is a circle (or a sphere in three dimensions), the total angular momentum
            with respect to the center of the container is also conserved (here we assume perfect reflection and particles have elastic collisions):
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            \[ L_z = \sum_{i=1}^N (\mathbf{r}_i \times \mathbf{p}_i)_z.\]
        </p>

        <p>
            The presence of this additional conserved quantity changes the structure of the
            equilibrium measure. Instead of the usual Gibbs ensemble, the system relaxes to a
            <em>generalized Gibbs ensemble</em> (GGE) in which both energy and angular momentum are fixed on average.
            The one–body distribution function that maximizes the entropy under these two constraints is
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            \[ 
            f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{p}) = Z^{-1} 
            \exp\!\big[-\beta \big(\tfrac{1}{2}|\mathbf{p}|^2 - \Omega\, (\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p})_z \big)\big],
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature and $\Omega$ is a Lagrange multiplier
            conjugate to the total angular momentum $L_z$.  The partition function $Z$ ensures normalization.
            Notice that, unlike the usual Maxwell–Boltzmann case, the distribution does not factorize into
            separate functions of $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{p}$:
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            \[ 
            f(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{p}) \neq g(\mathbf{r})\,h(\mathbf{p}).
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason is that angular momentum couples position and momentum degrees of freedom.
            Particles near the boundary tend to have tangential velocities, while particles near
            the center carry smaller angular momentum. The strength of this coupling can be
            quantified by introducing a dimensionless order parameter (which we show to be between 0 and 1)
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            \[ 
            \Xi = \frac{L_z^2}{2\,M\,R^2\,E},
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            Here $M=N$ is the total mass and $R$ the radius of the container.
            The dimensionless parameter $\Xi$ quantifies the relative weight of rotational energy
            with respect to the total energy, and can be interpreted as an “order parameter” 
            for the transition between the usual Gibbs regime and the angular–momentum–dominated regime.
            For $\Xi \approx 0$, the system behaves as an ordinary Gibbs ensemble with no net rotation.
            As $\Xi \to 1$, almost all of the energy is stored in collective rotational motion,
            approaching a rigidly rotating configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
            The stationary one–body distribution can be obtained by maximizing the entropy
            <span class="math">$S = -\!\int f \log f \, d\mathbf{r}\,d\mathbf{p}$</span>
            under the constraints of fixed normalization, total energy and total angular momentum.
            This leads to a generalized Gibbs ensemble of the form
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            \[ f(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{p}) = Z^{-1}\,
            \exp\!\left[-\beta_T
            \frac{|\mathbf{p}|^2}{2} -\beta_L \Omega\,(\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p})_z
            \right],
            \]
        </p>

        <p>
            where $\beta^{-1}$ is the kinetic (or “thermal”) temperature associated with the total energy,
            while the $\beta_L$ multiplier $\Omega$ defines a second, “rotational” temperature
            <span class="math">$T_\mathrm{rot}=\beta_L^{-1}$</span>
            that comes from the conservation of angular momentum.
            The competition between these two scales determines the stationary state.
        </p>

        <p>
            Integrating over momenta, one obtains the radial density profile
        </p>

        <p class="math">
            $$
            \rho(r) \propto r \,
            \exp\!\left[-\frac{\beta_L}{2}\, m\, \Omega^2 r^2 \right],
            $$
        </p>

        <p>
            where the effective inverse temperature $\beta_\mathrm{eff}$ depends on both $\beta$ and $\Omega$ 
            through the constraint fixing $\Xi$.
            For small $\Omega$ (or equivalently $\Xi \to 0$), the rotational temperature is negligible and
            $\rho(r)$ is nearly uniform, reproducing the standard Gibbs case.
            In contrast, as $\Xi \to 1$, the rotational temperature dominates:
            the centrifugal term $-\tfrac{1}{2}m\Omega^2 r^2$ confines most of the probability mass near the boundary,
            and $\rho(r)$ tends asymptotically to a Dirac delta centered at $r = R$.
        </p>

        <p>
            In other words, when angular momentum dominates, the steady state is characterized by a 
            thin, rotating layer of particles close to the circular boundary — a purely classical manifestation
            of a generalized Gibbs ensemble. Also, this implies that the system breaks ergodicity in a strong sense,
            as the accessible phase space is drastically reduced by the conservation of $L_z$, and in fact the gas becomes chiral.
            In contrast, if the same gas is placed in a square container, angular momentum is not conserved:
            collisions with the corners and walls continuously transfer angular momentum to the boundary.
            The system then relaxes to the usual Maxwell–Boltzmann equilibrium, with a uniform density profile.
            What is also interesting is that Bohr and van Leeuwen theorem states that in classical physics,
            in presence of magnetic fields there should be no magnetization at equilibrium. However, because a 
            magnetic field would induce a Lorentz force that breaks angular momentum conservation for the time it is active,
            it means that it precisely induces a rotation. As the field is switchedd off, the angular momentum is conserved and the gas 
            remains rotating.
            Yet, in this case, because of the conservation of angular momentum, one can have a net rotation
            of the gas at equilibrium, which is a sort of classical analog of remaining magnetization if the particles are charged
            (which would create other effects which we did not look into). 
        </p>

        <p>
            I built a small <a href="/simulations/gge.html" target="_blank"> simulator</a> to visualize these effects (getting quite some help from ChatGPT),
             and you can see this effect yourself. For the manuscript, we wrote three codes, one in Matlab and two in C, and we used both
             a event-driven and time-driven approach to simulate the hard-core collisions. The simulator on the website is a time-driven one,
             which is less efficient but easier to visualize.
            By choosing the boundary shape (circle or square), the number of particles, and the value of the
            parameter $\Xi$, one can observe in real time the transition between the Gibbs-like uniform
            distribution and the boundary-condensed rotating state predicted by the GGE.
