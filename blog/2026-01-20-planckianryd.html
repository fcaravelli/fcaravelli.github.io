  <h3>Engineering a Rydberg-like blockade with superconducting qubits and capacitive coupling</h3>
    <p><em>January 20, 2026</em></p>
  <p>
    Recently the Planckian team (a joint effort of the hardware and theory teams) released a preprint
    describing a new way to engineer strong longitudinal interactions between superconducting qubits using only capacitive coupling.
    Literally, it means getting two pieces of superconductive metal close to each other.
    Before I talk about what we achieved (and why I’m excited about it), let me set the technical stage in a way
    that is hopefully useful even if you don’t live and breathe superconducting circuits.
    The short version is: we engineered a <em>very large</em> longitudinal two-qubit interaction (a ZZ coupling) using
    a purely capacitive design, and we pushed it into a regime where it directly produces a dynamical blockade —
    essentially the superconducting-circuit analogue of a Rydberg blockade. This means that if one of the qubits is excited, 
    it will be hard to excite the other one using a drive pulse (etc, what is usually called a Rabi pi-pulse.)
  </p>

  <h4>Transmons, in a paragraph</h4>

  <p>
    A <strong>transmon</strong> is the workhorse superconducting qubit used in most circuit-QED processors.
    Technically, it’s a weakly anharmonic oscillator built from a Josephson junction shunted by a capacitance.
    The two lowest energy levels define the computational states <code>|0⟩</code> and <code>|1⟩</code>, but unlike an ideal
    two-level atom the spectrum continues: there is a <code>|2⟩</code>, <code>|3⟩</code>, etc.
    The crucial parameter is the <strong>anharmonicity</strong>, i.e. how much the <code>|1⟩→|2⟩</code> transition differs
    from the <code>|0⟩→|1⟩</code> transition. Transmons are <em>weakly</em> anharmonic: this makes them robust to charge noise,
    but it also means higher levels matter whenever you couple qubits strongly.
  </p>

  <h4>What is “capacitive coupling”</h4>

  <p>
    When you place two transmons near each other, you can couple them in different ways.
    <strong>Capacitive coupling</strong> means you literally engineer an electric-field interaction via a designed
    capacitance between the qubit islands. In the language of effective Hamiltonians, the dominant “exchange” term
    looks like an XY interaction: it tends to swap excitations between qubits (schematically, it connects
    <code>|10⟩</code> and <code>|01⟩</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
    So why is capacitive coupling interesting here? Because even if you start with an exchange-type interaction,
    the <em>combination</em> of coupling + weak anharmonicity + near-resonant level structure generates a sizeable
    <strong>effective longitudinal interaction</strong> of the form
    <code>ZZ</code>: an energy shift that depends on whether both qubits are excited.
    In practice, this shows up as a conditional frequency shift: the transition frequency of qubit A depends on the
    state of qubit B.
  </p>

  <h4>What “high detuning” meanss</h4>

  <p>
    A basic knob in two-qubit physics is the <strong>detuning</strong>, the difference between the bare qubit
    frequencies. If qubit 1 has frequency <code>ω1</code> and qubit 2 has <code>ω2</code>, the detuning is
    <code>Δ = ω1 − ω2</code>.
    When <code>|Δ|</code> is large compared to the coupling strength, the qubits are said to be “highly detuned”.
  </p>

  <p>
    In that regime, the exchange interaction is effectively turned off (because energy conservation suppresses
    swapping), and the qubits behave almost independently.
    This is often where people like to operate when they want to minimize crosstalk.
    The trade-off is that large detuning also tends to make conditional interactions like ZZ <em>small</em> and
    perturbative — useful for small phase gates, but not strong enough to dominate the driven dynamics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal in this work was essentially the opposite of the “keep everything perturbative” philosophy.
    We wanted a regime where the conditional shift is not a nuisance but the main resource — strong enough that the
    system’s response to a drive depends qualitatively on whether a neighboring qubit is excited.
  </p>
<h4>Effective Hamiltonian description from circuit QED</h4>

<p>
  The right way to understand what happens outside the perturbative, large-detuning regime is through an
  <strong>effective Hamiltonian</strong> description derived from circuit QED.
  Even though we often speak loosely about “two-level qubits”, transmons are not true two-level systems,
  and the higher excited states play a central role in generating conditional interactions.
</p>

<p>
  At the circuit level, two capacitively coupled transmons can be modeled as two weakly anharmonic oscillators
  with an exchange-type coupling. A minimal Hamiltonian reads
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
  H
  =
  \sum_{i=1}^2
  \left(
    \omega_i a_i^\dagger a_i
    + \frac{\alpha_i}{2} a_i^{\dagger 2} a_i^2
  \right)
  +
  g\left(a_1^\dagger a_2 + a_1 a_2^\dagger\right),
\]
</p>

<p>
  where <code>ωi</code> are the bare qubit frequencies, <code>αi</code> are the (negative) transmon anharmonicities,
  and <code>g</code> is the capacitive exchange coupling.
  Importantly, there is no explicit ZZ term written here: the longitudinal interaction is not put in by hand,
  but emerges from the combination of coupling and anharmonicity.
</p>

<p>
  To see this, one performs a controlled elimination of the non-computational states, keeping track of virtual
  transitions involving the <code>|20⟩</code> and <code>|02⟩</code> manifolds.
  At second order in the coupling, this procedure generates an effective interaction in the computational
  subspace whose diagonal part can be written as
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
  H_{\mathrm{eff}}
  =
  \frac{\tilde\omega_1}{2}\sigma_z^{(1)}
  +
  \frac{\tilde\omega_2}{2}\sigma_z^{(2)}
  +
  \frac{J}{2}
  \left(
    \sigma_x^{(1)}\sigma_x^{(2)}
    +
    \sigma_y^{(1)}\sigma_y^{(2)}
  \right)
  +
  \frac{\zeta}{4}\sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}.
\]
</p>

<p>
  The key term for our purposes is the last one: the <strong>ZZ interaction</strong>.
  Its strength can be written, in the dispersive regime, as
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
  \zeta
  \simeq
  2g^2
  \left(
    \frac{1}{\Delta + |\alpha_2|}
    -
    \frac{1}{\Delta - |\alpha_1|}
  \right),
\]
</p>

<p>
  where <code>Δ = ω1 − ω2</code> is the detuning.
  This expression makes two points immediately clear.
</p>

<p>
  First, the ZZ interaction is entirely a <em>many-level effect</em>: it originates from virtual excursions into
  higher excited states and vanishes in a strict two-level truncation.
  Second, while at very large detuning it scales as <code>g²/Δ</code> and is therefore small, it can become
  dramatically enhanced as the detuning is reduced toward the scale set by the anharmonicities.
</p>

<p>
  Operationally, the ZZ term means that the energy of the doubly excited state <code>|11⟩</code> is shifted relative
  to the sum of single-qubit energies:
</p>

<p class="math">
\[
  \zeta
  =
  E_{11} - E_{10} - E_{01} + E_{00}.
\]
</p>

<p>
  Equivalently, each qubit’s transition frequency becomes conditional on the state of its neighbor.
  If qubit 2 is in <code>|1⟩</code> rather than <code>|0⟩</code>, qubit 1’s resonance is shifted by an amount
  <code>ζ</code>, and vice versa.
  This conditional shift is exactly what is measured spectroscopically and via Ramsey-type experiments.
</p>

<p>
  In most superconducting architectures, one tries to stay in a regime where <code>|ζ|</code> is small compared
  to typical Rabi frequencies, so that it can be refocused or treated as a minor correction.
  In this work, we deliberately engineered the opposite limit:
  a regime where <code>|ζ|</code> becomes the dominant energy scale in the driven dynamics.
</p>

<p>
  Once this happens, the effective Hamiltonian is no longer best thought of as “two weakly interacting qubits”,
  but rather as a system with an intrinsic energetic constraint on double excitation.
  That constraint is the foundation of the dynamical blockade physics discussed next.
</p>

  <h4>What is the ZZ interaction, physically?</h4>

  <p>
    The <strong>ZZ coupling</strong> is easiest to understand operationally:
    it is the statement that the energy of the two-qubit state <code>|11⟩</code> is shifted relative to what you would
    expect from adding the two single-qubit energies.
    Equivalently, it means the transition frequency of one qubit is different depending on whether the other qubit is
    in <code>|0⟩</code> or <code>|1⟩</code>. This is a conditional energy penalty (or conditional Stark shift) for double
    excitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In many superconducting designs, residual ZZ is treated as an error channel.
    Here we deliberately engineered it to be large, stable, and predictable — and we did it in a minimalist way
    using capacitive coupling rather than adding a tunable coupler element.
  </p>

  <h4>Connecting to the Rydberg blockade</h4>

  <p>
    With that picture in mind, the connection to the <strong>Rydberg blockade</strong> becomes very concrete.
    In a Rydberg array, one excitation shifts neighbors so strongly that subsequent excitations are pushed out of
    resonance. In our circuit setting, a large ZZ shift does the same thing:
    once one transmon is in <code>|1⟩</code>, the neighbor’s transition is shifted by an amount that can exceed the drive
    bandwidth or the achievable Rabi frequency, so that a resonant global drive cannot excite it.
    That is the blockade, in the simplest operational sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    The conceptual punchline is that the blockade is not “a gate” — it is a dynamical constraint produced by the
    interaction spectrum itself. That’s exactly the ingredient that makes Rydberg platforms so powerful for
    globally driven, constrained dynamics, and it’s what we wanted to bring into superconducting hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    So what did we manage to do, concretely?
    We designed and experimentally realized a capacitively coupled transmon device where the effective ZZ interaction
    becomes an <em>order-one energy scale</em> in the dynamics, rather than a small perturbation.
    This required going beyond the usual comfort zone of “large detuning, weak coupling” and instead engineering a
    regime where the circuit parameters and level structure amplify the conditional shift while maintaining
    experimental control and coherence.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the engineering side, this was not a one-shot design. It took sustained iteration — circuit modeling,
    electromagnetic design, fabrication constraints, packaging realities, and then the hard part: getting the device
    to behave quantitatively like the model in the lab.
    A big part of what made the project work was the tight feedback loop within the Planckian team between theory and
    experiment: we weren’t just “observing a large shift”, we were targeting a parameter regime and checking that the
    measured spectra and driven dynamics match what the quantization and effective-Hamiltonian analysis predicts.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I personally like about this result is that it reframes a familiar superconducting-circuit quantity
    (ZZ crosstalk) as a resource for a different operating mode.
    Once ZZ becomes large, you can do things that look much closer to the Rydberg playbook:
    global drives, interaction-induced constraints, blockade-based selectivity, and eventually many-body dynamics in
    constrained Hilbert spaces — but in a platform that is fast, lithographically scalable, and naturally integrable.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the first wave of superconducting quantum computing has been about making gates cleaner and cleaner, I see this
    direction as complementary: using engineered interactions to make <em>the physics</em> do more of the work.
    That’s the broader motivation behind what we did here, connected to how some of our architectures work.
