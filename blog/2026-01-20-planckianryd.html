  <h3>Engineering a Rydberg-like blockade with superconducting qubits and capacitive coupling</h3>

  <p>
    Let me step back from the formal presentation of the results and explain, from a more personal and technical
    point of view, what we were really trying to achieve in this work, and why we think it matters.
    At its core, this project is about taking an idea that is extremely natural in atomic physics — the Rydberg
    blockade — and asking whether the same <em>interaction-dominated logic</em> can be realized in a solid-state
    superconducting platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Rydberg arrays, the blockade is almost a gift from nature: exciting one atom to a high-lying Rydberg state
    shifts the energy levels of its neighbors so strongly that further excitations are suppressed.
    This single mechanism underlies fast multi-qubit gates, constrained Hilbert spaces, and globally driven
    many-body dynamics. In superconducting circuits, by contrast, we usually live in the opposite regime:
    interactions are weak, perturbative, and carefully engineered <em>not</em> to interfere with local control.
  </p>

  <p>
    The central question we asked ourselves was therefore very concrete:
    <strong>can we deliberately push superconducting qubits into a regime where interactions dominate the driven dynamics,
    rather than being a small correction?</strong>
    And if so, can we do it in a way that is scalable and compatible with realistic hardware constraints?
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer turned out to be yes — but only if one takes the longitudinal (ZZ) interaction seriously as a
    resource, rather than treating it as an unwanted parasitic effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    In most circuit-QED architectures, the ZZ coupling between qubits is something to be minimized.
    It shows up as residual phase accumulation, crosstalk, or gate errors, and entire coupler designs are built
    to cancel it as effectively as possible.
    Here, we did the opposite: we asked how large the ZZ interaction can be made using nothing more exotic than
    careful capacitive engineering between transmon qubits.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we found — both theoretically and experimentally — is that by working close to resonance and exploiting
    the weak anharmonicity of transmons, the ZZ interaction can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude
    compared to previously reported capacitively coupled devices.
    In the strongest regime we explored, the ZZ coupling reached hundreds of MHz, becoming the largest energy
    scale in the driven dynamics, larger than typical Rabi frequencies and comparable to the qubit anharmonicity.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a physical point of view, this interaction has a very simple interpretation:
    it is an energy penalty for occupying the <code>|11⟩</code> state.
    When one qubit is excited, the transition frequency of its neighbor is shifted so far that a resonant drive
    simply cannot excite it anymore.
    This is exactly the same logic that underlies the Rydberg blockade, but implemented here in a fully engineered,
    solid-state system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key difference — and also the opportunity — is that in superconducting circuits the interaction strength,
    the detuning, and the drive parameters are all tunable in situ.
    This allows us to smoothly interpolate between weakly interacting, gate-based operation and a genuinely
    interaction-dominated regime where global drives and constrained dynamics become natural.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the technology side, this project was not a short effort.
    It took several years of iterative design, modeling, fabrication, and measurement to reach a regime where
    the ZZ interaction was both strong and clean enough to demonstrate a true dynamical blockade.
    A crucial ingredient was the tight feedback loop between theory, circuit quantization, and experiment inside
    the Planckian team: we were able to predict the interaction strength from black-box quantization, design the
    capacitive coupling accordingly, and then verify quantitatively that the measured spectra and dynamics matched
    those predictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I personally find most exciting is not the two-qubit blockade itself, but what it points to.
    Once you can engineer a strong, local energy penalty for simultaneous excitations, you open the door to
    globally controlled architectures, collective quantum dynamics, and constrained many-body Hamiltonians
    that are extremely hard to realize in standard gate-based superconducting processors.
    In this sense, the experiment is best seen as a proof of principle that superconducting circuits can access
    the same interaction-driven physics that has made Rydberg platforms so powerful — but with the speed,
    integrability, and flexibility of solid-state hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work sits at the intersection of condensed matter, quantum optics, and quantum engineering, and reflects
    a broader direction we are pursuing at Planckian: using carefully engineered interactions, rather than ever
    more complex control stacks, as the foundation for scalable quantum architectures.
