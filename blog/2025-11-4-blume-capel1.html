      <h2>The Blume–Capel Model in One Dimension</h2>
      <p class="post-date"><em>November 4, 2025</em></p>
      <p>
        Typically, blogs that cover topics in Statistical Mechanics, Condensed Matter, or Computational Physics
        focus on the <strong>Ising model</strong> as a prototypical system before discussing more complex models.
        However, the Ising model is just one member of a broader family of lattice models that capture various physical phenomena.
        Two colleagues recently asked if we could discuss with them of the <strong>Blume–Capel model</strong> in the context
        of some experiments that they are performing, and I went to look into my notes. What results is this blog post!
        Now, I have a lot of notes and I just pick models I have solved or looked into from time to time, so expect more posts like this in the future.
        Also, many of these notes will go, with exercises, into three volumes that I am writing with Diego Dalvit, Alioscia Hamma and Juan Zanella.
        Going back to the Ising model in 1D, the solution of this model is a classic exercise in Statistical Mechanics, often solved using the transfer matrix method.
        It is the same for the Blume-Capel model, which can be seen as a generalization of the Ising model to spin-1 variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is interesting about the Blume-Capel model is also a model in which microcanonical and canonical ensembles disagree
        in certain regions of the phase diagram, leading to intriguing thermodynamic behavior. We will come back to these at a certain point.
        For now, we discuss the model and its exact solution in one dimension using the transfer matrix method.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Blume–Capel model</strong> is a generalization of the Ising model, first introduced independently by
        <strong>Melvin Blume</strong> and <strong>H. W. Capel</strong> in 1966. Its Hamiltonian reads:
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - d \sum_i s_i^2 - h \sum_i s_i,
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        where $s_i = -1, 0, 1$ represents a spin-1 variable that can occupy one of three states.
        The parameter $J$ controls the ferromagnetic coupling between neighboring spins, $d$ (often denoted $D$)
        is a single-ion anisotropy or <em>crystal-field coupling</em>, and $h$ is an external magnetic field.
      </p>

      <p>
        The model extends the standard Ising picture by including a “neutral” state $s_i = 0$, which can be interpreted as a
        <strong>vacancy</strong> or non-magnetic configuration. This additional degree of freedom leads to a rich phase diagram.
        The system exhibits both <strong>second-order</strong> and <strong>first-order</strong> phase transitions, depending on the temperature
        and the value of $d$. For large positive $d$, the neutral state dominates, suppressing magnetization; for smaller or negative $d$,
        the $\pm1$ states become energetically favorable, and ferromagnetic order may emerge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Originally formulated to describe magnetic materials such as <em>UO₂</em> with crystal-field splitting,
        the Blume–Capel model was later found to apply to <em>³He–⁴He mixtures</em>, where the $s = 0$ state corresponds to a
        ⁴He atom and $s = \pm 1$ to ³He. In that context, the quadrupole moment
        $1 - \langle s^2 \rangle$ corresponds to the ³He concentration.
        (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.141.517">Blume, Phys. Rev. 141, 517 (1966)</a>;
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0031-8914(66)90027-9">Capel, Physica 32, 966 (1966)</a>;

      </p>

      <p>
        Despite its apparent simplicity, the Blume–Capel model captures the essential ingredients of
        <strong>first-order transitions</strong>, <strong>tricritical points</strong>, and <strong>vacancy-mediated magnetism</strong>.
        It also serves as a conceptual bridge between the Ising and <em>Potts</em> models, representing one of the earliest
        multi-state generalizations of the Ising paradigm.
      </p>

      <h3>The One-Dimensional Case</h3>

      <p>
        In this post, we explore the <strong>exact solution of the 1D Blume–Capel model on a ring</strong>
        using the <em>transfer matrix method</em>. Although the one-dimensional system does not exhibit a true phase transition
        at finite temperature, it remains a valuable pedagogical example — simple enough to solve analytically, yet rich enough
        to reveal the mathematical structure of the model.
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        H = -J \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} s_i s_{i+1} - d \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i^2 - h \sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i,
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        where $s_i = -1, 0, 1$, and $N$ is the number of sites in the chain.
        The goal is to express the partition function in terms of a <em>transfer matrix</em>,
        find its eigenvalues, and compute the free energy in the thermodynamic limit.
      </p>

      <h3>Solution Outline</h3>

      <p>
        The Boltzmann weight for a spin configuration is
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        w(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_N) = e^{-\beta H},
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        and we define the <strong>transfer matrix</strong> $R(s, s')$ as
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        R(s,s') = e^{-\beta H_f(s)/2} e^{-\beta H_{int}(s,s')} e^{-\beta H_f(s')/2}.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        For the Blume–Capel model, this yields a $3\times3$ matrix representation:
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        R =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        e^{\beta (J + d + h)} & e^{\beta (d + h)/2} & e^{\beta (-J + d)} \\
        e^{\beta (d + h)/2} & 1 & e^{\beta (d - h)/2} \\
        e^{\beta (-J + d)} & e^{\beta (d - h)/2} & e^{\beta (J + d - h)}
        \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        The eigenvector
        $\psi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)$
        has eigenvalue
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \lambda = 2 e^{\beta d} \sinh(\beta J).
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        The remaining two eigenvalues, $\lambda_\pm$, are found analytically as
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        \lambda_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}\left(
        2 e^{\beta d} \cosh(\beta J)
        \pm
        \sqrt{8 e^{\beta d} + \left( 2 e^{\beta d} \cosh(\beta J) - 1 \right)^2}
        + 1
        \right).
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        The partition function is therefore
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        Z = \lambda_+^N + \lambda^N + \lambda_-^N,
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        and in the thermodynamic limit $N \to \infty$, the free energy per site is dominated by the largest eigenvalue:
      </p>

      <p class="math">
        \[
        f = -kT \ln \lambda_+.
        \]
      </p>

      <p>
        This exact solution highlights how the transfer matrix approach provides a powerful and elegant method to treat
        lattice models in 1- and 2- dimensions, even when the spin variables take on more than two values.
        In higher dimensions, the Blume–Capel model continues to serve as a paradigmatic system for studying
        tricritical behavior and universality classes at the boundary between first- and second-order phase transitions.
        We will come back to this model in other posts.
