<h2> The sacred art of being lost - Francesco Caravelli</h2>
<p>In the next few weeks I’ll share more technical posts, but today I wanted to write something more personal.</p>

<p>In February 2023, I made the decision to leave my position as a Staff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I won’t go into the reasons (there were several, including personal ones), but that day I literally packed my office into boxes. It took a few weeks to bring everything home.</p>

<p>For the next three months I looked for a new job—basically, something interesting enough to pull me forward. I applied to a few universities, national labs, and research institutes. I had some interviews, but nothing really clicked. I’m not entirely sure why, but I don’t think I’m “the professor type.” I’ve always felt more at home in private research institutes.</p>

<p>During my PhD I was at the University of Waterloo, but spent much of my time at Perimeter. I later visited the Santa Fe Institute, and consulted for them while I was a postdoc at OCIAM in Oxford. Then I moved to the private sector as a researcher, while being based at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences. And finally I ended up at Los Alamos. Looking back, it’s pretty clear: I’ve consistently gravitated toward places with a strong institute culture.</p>

<p>Leaving LANL was bittersweet. I really liked Los Alamos, and overall I liked my job. It was a permanent position, and I had been there for more than seven years.</p>

<p>What I loved most was the problem-solving. Research culture at LANL is strong: people are constantly talking science at whiteboards and blackboards, it’s highly collaborative (at least in T-Division, where I was), and—most of the time—the science is what matters. Resources are excellent, too. And to be clear: leaving wasn’t about failing as a scientist. If anything, it was the opposite.</p>

<p>One thing that always sticks with me during transitions is the need for an interesting problem to solve. I once read that Feynman had a similar itch; in one of his books he mentions spending time trying to understand the dynamics of a dish spinning in the air. National labs are full of fascinating problems, and LANL is no exception. But if you haven’t been sleeping under a rock over the last year or so, you can probably guess what was coming. Let’s just say I wasn’t excited about the direction things were heading.</p>

<p>The reasons were multiple, but the main one was that I felt stuck—not stuck in terms of growth or ability, but stuck in terms of exploration. I felt fixed on a direction, at a time when I needed to be able to wander.</p>

<p>There’s a line (from <em>The Night Flier</em>, based on a Stephen King story) that I’ve always liked: “Don’t believe what you publish, and don’t publish what you believe.” That’s a version of scientific discipline: stay honest, stay provisional. But the track I was on started to feel like following a compass needle while the compass itself was being dragged around—always pointing somewhere, but no longer toward anything I trusted as “true north.”</p>

<p>So I left. And what I realized, in the months after, was that I needed to be lost again.</p>

<p>The thing is, I also don’t love jumping on bandwagons. Science can feel like a cycle of hype waves—at least at a superficial level. At a deeper level, of course, there <em>are</em> movements driven by real curiosity and substance. But those aren’t always the ones getting the attention they deserve.</p>

<p>On a side note, lately I’ve been following the search for Céline Cremer in Tasmania (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/31/tasmania-missing-hiker-celine-cremer-search-resumes-after-four-days-as-fears-grow-over-survival" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). There are few feelings as helpless as being lost in the wild. If it’s happened to you, you know what I mean.</p>

<p>I once got lost for a few hours while trail running alone in Santa Fe. It wasn’t dramatic—I made a dumb decision and tried to find my way back without a map or GPS, and ended up running in circles until I hit a road. I had to call my wife to come pick me up. I was lucky: it was still daylight, and I had water and some food. A friend of mine got lost nearby for an entire night, and he told me it was one of the scariest experiences of his life.</p>

<p>Being lost in nature isn’t so different from being lost in your career (or your life). When you’re lost outside, you focus on survival: water, shelter, food. When you’re lost professionally, you focus on the equivalents: opportunities, direction, challenges—and if you have a family to provide for, the stakes are even higher.</p>

<p>I’ve felt this before. Midway through my PhD, I was lost too. I wasn’t sure what to do next, and I wasn’t sure I wanted to stay in academia. I remember telling my advisor that I didn’t think quantum gravity was for me. She told me to slow down, take a break, and not rush the decision. I was lucky to be in Berlin at the time—that period became a turning point. I realized I wanted to explore new directions, and work on problems that were more interdisciplinary.</p>

<p>If you’re lost in your research, a good move is often lateral but adjacent: switch problems, learn new methods, meet new collaborators—then come back. If the problem really matters to you, you’ll be drawn back to it. Career-wise, I think the same applies. If you feel stuck, move. Explore. Get out of the mud.</p>

<p>Paul Graham (cofounder of Y Combinator) once said that “the most important thing you can do as a startup founder is to be working on something you care about.” Maybe we should think of the scientific method the same way: as something that needs room to iterate, pivot, and grow organically. Are small institutes—where that kind of organic growth is more natural—the way forward? I don’t know.</p>

<p>But I do know this: being lost isn’t always a failure. Sometimes it’s the beginning of something better.</p>
