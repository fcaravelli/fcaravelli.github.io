      <h2>Workshops & Schools</h2>
      <p><em>A selection of scientific events I have organized or co-organized, bringing together researchers across complex systems, computation, and physics.</em></p>

      <!-- Conclave -->
      <section class="project">
        <h3>The Conclave on Computation and Complexity (2023)</h3>
        <p>
          Organized with Michael Saccone, Luis Pedro Garcia-Pintos, and Cristiano Nisoli. The Conclave gathered experts in complex systems, network theory, and computation to explore emergent computational paradigms and the boundaries between physics and information science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event fostered discussion around computational complexity in natural and artificial systems, featuring interdisciplinary panels and interactive sessions.
          Among the invited speakers, we had Chris Jarzynski, Cris Moore, David Wolpert, Dante Chialvo, Zdenka Kuncic, Gianluca Milano, Kilian Stenning, Mikhail Prokopenko, Valentina Baccetti
          and many others.

      <!-- Spectral Methods -->
      <section class="project">
        <h3>Online Winter School on Spectral Methods for Complex Systems (2020)</h3>
        <p>
          Co-organized with <strong>Lyubov Tupikina</strong>.  
          The main motivation for this online Winter School was to learn about the broad applications of spectral methods, exchange new ideas, and record lectures that are now freely available online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Topics included spectral graph theory, community detection, eigenvalue spectra of complex systems, and data-driven dynamical modeling.

      <!-- ETOCS -->
      <section class="project">
        <h3>Emergent Topological Order in Classical Systems (ETOCS) Workshop (2018)</h3>
        <p>
          Co-Organizer with Cristiano Nisoli, Eli Ben-Naim and Avadh Saxena, through the Center for Nonlinear Studies, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).
          The workshop explored emergent topological order and collective phenomena in classical systems, with applications to spin ices, artificial neural networks, 
          and metamaterials.
            
        </p>
        <p>
          Invited speakers included leading figures in statistical mechanics and complex systems, contributing to cross-disciplinary research on emergent behavior.

      <!-- NEEFS -->
      <section class="project">
        <h3>NEEFS 2016 – Non-Stationarity and Ergodicity in Economic and Financial Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Organizer (with Marco Bardoscia and Fabio Caccioli) of the NEEFS 2016 satellite meeting at <em>Conference on Complex Systems (CCS 2016)</em>, Amsterdam.
          The workshop focused on non-equilibrium behavior, ergodicity, and time series in financial and economic systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Invited speakers included Doyne Farmer, Ole Peters, and Guido Caldarelli, with discussions on stochastic modeling, statistical physics, and complex dynamics in markets.
